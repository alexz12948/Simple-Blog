<h1>Home Page</h1>
<p>This is a simple blog post that allows you to navivate through auxillary
 pages and use this program as a blog/diary. Start by pushing the compose
 link in the top right and write your first post! Once you have your first
 post, you can click on the Read More link that will take you to a completely
 separate page, which will help clear out the clutter once there are too many
 posts 😁</p>

<%postList.forEach(function(post) { %>
  <h1><%= post.title %></h1>
  <p><%= post.body.substr(0,100)%> ... <a href="/posts/<%= post.title %>">Read More</a></p>
<%});%>

<%- include("partials/footer"); %>
