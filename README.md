# Simple Blog
A simple yet functional blog with no english text (just placeholder text)

## How to Run
After you clone the repository, navigate to the repository via the CLI and run `npm i` in order to download all of the necessary modules to run the website

Then run `node app.js` to start up the server and navigate to localhost:3000 in order to view the website. An easy way to check it out is to use google chrome and type localhost:3000 into the search bar

## Funcionality
Essentially, it allows the user to go to the compose tab in the navigation bar, create a post, and publish it to the home page. When the user pushes the Read More button, it directs them to another page where the post can be fully displayed on a webpage. 

## Note
All of the .ejs and .js files were written by me however I used Angela Yu's css style sheet in order to make the website look polished
